# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is my second project of the triple ten program. While it is very similar to the first project, there new features that I added to this project.
## Project features

this project had a lot of the same features as the first project, but there were some new ones. 

for example,

### Forms

  While working with forms, I learned how to work with **inputs** and **labels**. 

  the main types of **Inputs** are

  * text 
  * number
  * email 
  * password 

  Like images, Inputs don't require a closing tag, but they do require an **Id** tag.

  We give our Inputs a name with the **Label** attribute and pair them with the **for** attribute.

  ### Embedding Content 

  This part of the project was fairly easy. 

  In order to embed content from youtube or spotify, you have to use the **iframe** attribute. 

  again, very similar to the *image* attribute. While using iframe, I was able to become better with my flexbox and positioning skills.

  ### Animations and special effects

  This was definitely the hardest part of the project. 

  A lot of code and a lot of mental stability goes into making these animations. 

  using the **@keyframes** attribute you can create animations that are visually stunning and impressive. 

## Plans on improving the project

I would want to create an animation for the background of the reservation page. The image fits well, but I feel it would be more appealing to viewers if the background moved while they made a reservation.
